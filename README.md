# Libft Unit Test

A comprehensive suite of unit tests for the Libft project, built using [Unity-master](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) â€“ a lightweight C testing framework.

## Overview

From the beginning of my journey at 1337 School, I aimed to cover all the essential skills required in the real-world job market. By embracing Test-Driven Development (TDD) early on, I integrated testing into every project. This repository provides unit tests for every function in my Libft project, ensuring code reliability and ease of maintenance.

## Features

- **Test-Driven Development:** Developed using TDD practices to ensure robust, error-free code.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Covers all Libft functions.
- **Simple Integration:** Easily integrate your Libft project with the test suite.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AzzaouiAlae/Libft_Unit_Test.git
   ```

2. **Directory Setup:**

   Ensure that you have both the `Tests_libft` directory and your `libft` repository located in the same parent directory.

## Running the Tests

Navigate to the `Tests_libft` directory in your terminal:

```bash
cd Tests_libft
```

Then, compile and run the tests using the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will build the test suite and execute all unit tests, providing you with detailed feedback on your functions.
